### Research Experiences
#### Video Analysis and Recognition of Infant Attachment in Mother-Infant Interaction Scene
- Project Leader; Advisor: Jinshi Cui, Associate Professor at School of EECS, Peking University
- Pre-processed the video data and extracted features such as skeleton, location, orientation for classifying
behaviors and emotions which were created by working with psychology professor based on priori knowledge.
- Used the result of classification to predict attachment type and achieve achieved human level performance.
- With this method involved, at least 95% time in analyzing video data can be saved.

#### Personalities Study based on Personal Gaze Patterns 09/2018-05/2019 Research Assistant; Advisor: Jinshi Cui, Associate Professor at School of EECS, Peking University
- Collected people’s gaze data and did the data preprocess.
- Extracted features like fixations, saccades and pupil diameters and used a Random Forest algorithm to predict
the Big Five personality. The prediction accuracy is better than state-of-the-arts.
- This work has been presented in The 13th International Workshop on Robust Computer Vision(IWRCV2019)

#### Kaggle Competition: Predict Future Sales 07/2018-08/2018 Project Member; Advisor: Yan Liu, Associate Professor of the Viterbi School of Engineering at USC
- Analyzed the data and did the data pre-processing.
- Added the features such as time, price and place, and then predicted by XGBOOST algorithm.
- Adjusted parameters, features and other factors until getting the optimal result, in order to find the best feature
- The final score was 0.89310, and ranking is Top 3%

#### The Appointment Platform ‘Rebooter’, a WeChat Mini Application on Campus 05/2018-07/2018 Front-end Developer; Advisor: Yanchun Sun, Associate Professor at School of EECS, Peking University
- Compiled the software requirement specifications by analyzing the needs of campus students.
- Used WXSS, WXML and JAVASCRIPT to develop the functions, including authentication login, room
creation, interest subscription, condition filtering, chat and etc.
- Completed a campus dating application that have multiple section, could subscribe and real-time interact.
- This platform is already in use by EECS volunteer organization of Peking University.
